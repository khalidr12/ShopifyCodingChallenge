I am writing this README on the bus; on the way to work at the moment, so excuse the lack luster formatting and grammatical errors. Just for context, this isn’t my first repo. I had another one on my Mac laptop since Mac > Windows. However, my git on that laptop wouldn’t recognize my account or grant me access it. So I had to use my throw away account (this) and copy all the files onto a USB and move them to my Windows laptop and add the files into a new repo here. So please don’t be impressed when you see how few the PRs are, most of the work was already done before the initial commit on this repo. I hope you enjoy the application, as I thoroughly enjoyed the processing of getting it to where it is now!

I have attached below the schema for the application, and explained the various features in the application as well.
